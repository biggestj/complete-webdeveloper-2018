// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  
let firstNumber = prompt("Enter first number");
let secondNumber = prompt("Enter second number");
let sum = alert("sum = " + firstNumber + secondNumber);

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
let sum = alert("sum = " + (firstNumber + secondNumber) + "\nsubstraction = " + (firstNumber - secondNumber) + "\nmultiplied = " + firstNumber * secondNumber + "\ndivision = " + firstNumber / secondNumber);
